# source{d} paper reading club

Discuss papers at the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Machine
Learning communities related to applications of Machine Learning to Code.


## Goal

- promote reading papers
- rise awareness on current research directions in PL, SW, ML communities
- create opportunity for collaborations


## How it works

Every 2 weeks we pick and discuss a paper.

Next paper is chosen from a list of candidates established at the end of the session.

Anyone can comment on a paper's PDF on [GDrive][GDrive] with questions or things that are worth
clarifying.


## Next sessions
- __Extra session on 2018.10.5__ at 4pm CET, we'll study [Code Vectors: Understanding Programs Through Embedded Abstracted Symbolic Traces](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NyGQXxF2Ctq21wYcMjFWGyW0mwmDrXkD). This time we will be joined by *Jordan Henkel*, one of the authors of the paper! Please write any questions you might have in [this GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjiRzSivxXDDl79Fq4Bs7Ax3Zz7hciRGPKxKrUHFd6I/edit).
