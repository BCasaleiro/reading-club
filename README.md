# source{d} paper reading club

Discuss papers at the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Machine
Learning communities related to applications of Machine Learning to Code.


## Goal

- promote reading papers
- rise awareness on current research directions in PL, SW, ML communities
- create opportunity for collaborations


## How it works

Every 2 weeks we pick and discuss a paper.

Next paper is chosen from a list of candidates established at the end of the session.

Anyone can comment on a paper's PDF on [GDrive][GDrive] with questions or things that are worth
clarifying.
