# source{d} paper reading club

Discuss papers at the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Machine
Learning communities related to applications of Machine Learning to Code.


## Goal

- promote reading papers
- rise awareness on current research directions in PL, SW, ML communities
- create opportunity for collaborations


## How it works

Every 2 weeks we pick and discuss a paper.

Next paper is chosen from a list of candidates established at the end of the session.

Anyone can comment on a paper's PDF on [GDrive][GDrive] with questions or things that are worth
clarifying.


## Next sessions
- __2018.10.19__ at 4pm CET, paper [Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gAOdA8S2E9YbOP3AEaYkK3hFTB5cVBAw/view). Don't hesitate to
annotate the paper with any remark or question and to write your more general questions on the
[questions GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHNoaL2U00TXfgAWoEOgUzNP8vCW34P1psL01Hc1nNU/edit)!
